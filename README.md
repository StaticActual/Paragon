### Description

Paragon is an automated equities trading application. It's an adaptation of the Quiver and Quiver-v2 projects designed to work with Tradier Brokerage. Unlike Quiver-v2, it does not have a frontend or an accessable API, and instead relies on Tradier's applications to view activity.

### Repo Information 

This repository contains the Paragon project. It's written in Node.js with the Express framework and uses MongoDB for data storage.
